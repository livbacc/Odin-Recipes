   <p>The first step to making an arepa is the harina (flour). My personal favorite is the brand Harina P.A.N. Mix the following ingredients in a bowl.
    <ul>
        <li> 2 1/2 cups of warm water</li>
        <li> a pinch of salt</li>
        <li> a splash of olive oil</li>
        <li> 2 cups of water</li>
    </ul>
    Let rest for 5 minutes while you heat up your pan (a cast iron pan is the best but non stick will work as well)</p.>
    <p>Add butter or olive oil to you pan and let it heat up. While the pan is heating up make round balls about the size of your palm and flatten them between your palms. They should be about 1/2 inch thick or less. Cook until golden brown on both sides. This recipe yields about 4 arepas.
    </p>
    <p>After they are finished cooking, let rest for a few minutes before you open them. They can be filled with eggs and cheese for breakfast, shredded chicken, beef or pork, or really anything you would like. To open them just slice in half with a butter knife and enjoy like a sandwich! </p>
    <p> Arepas have become a comfort food for me as they are so versitile and one of my husbands favorite foods! Some of my favorite ways to enjoy them are with scrambled eggs and cheese in the morning, or with <a href="https://www.curiouscuisiniere.com/carne-mechada/">Carne Mechada</a> with mayo and avacado!</p>
